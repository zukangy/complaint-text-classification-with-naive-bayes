# complaint-text-classification-with-naive-bayes

## Business Objective:

Fintech companies offer various financial products for their users, and provide 
customer service when users come across issues with the products they purchased.
When a customer submits a complaint, we want to know which product/service the complaint 
is associated with, such that we can route the complaint to the corresponding department for 
resolution.

Here, we want to build a text classification model to classify the product/service a complaint
is pointing to, given the complaint narrative provided by the customer. We are interested in exploring
how well different classification models can do on this task.
